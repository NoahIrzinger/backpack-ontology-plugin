# Backpack Guide

Backpack is the user's persistent knowledge base — a single backpack they carry across every conversation. Inside it are **ontologies**, each one a knowledge graph about a different topic (clients, processes, architecture, etc.).

## Core Concept

There is one backpack. Inside it are ontologies. Each ontology is a typed graph: **nodes** (things) connected by **edges** (relationships). There are no enforced schemas — decide what structure fits the domain. Nodes have a freeform `type` and arbitrary `properties`. Edges have a `type` connecting a source to a target.

## Progressive Discovery Pattern

Always follow this layered approach to keep the context window lean. Start broad, drill down only as needed.

### Layer 1: Discover

Start here. Understand what ontologies exist before doing anything else.

- `backpack_list` — list all ontologies with names, descriptions, and summary counts
- `backpack_create` — create a new empty ontology
- `backpack_describe` — inspect an ontology's structure: node types, edge types, counts

### Layer 2: Browse

Once you know which ontology to work with, explore its contents.

- `backpack_node_types` — list distinct node types with counts
- `backpack_list_nodes` — paginated node summaries, optionally filtered by type
- `backpack_search` — case-insensitive text search across all node properties

### Layer 3: Inspect

Pull full details only for specific nodes of interest.

- `backpack_get_node` — full node with all properties and connected edge summaries
- `backpack_get_neighbors` — BFS graph traversal from a node (max depth 3)

### Layer 4: Mutate

Create or modify data only after understanding the existing structure.

- `backpack_add_node` — add a node with a freeform type and properties
- `backpack_update_node` — merge new properties into an existing node
- `backpack_remove_node` — remove a node and cascade-delete its edges
- `backpack_add_edge` — create a typed relationship between two nodes
- `backpack_remove_edge` — remove a relationship
- `backpack_import_nodes` — bulk-add multiple nodes in a single operation

## Best Practices

1. **Always call `backpack_list` first** to see what already exists. Never create a duplicate ontology.
2. **Use `backpack_describe` before mutating** to understand the existing schema — match existing node types and edge types rather than inventing new ones that overlap.
3. **Use `backpack_search` before adding nodes** to avoid duplicates.
4. **Keep node types consistent** — use singular PascalCase (e.g., `Person`, `Module`, `Recipe`).
5. **Keep edge types consistent** — use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE verbs (e.g., `WORKS_ON`, `DEPENDS_ON`, `CONTAINS`).
6. **Use meaningful properties** — include enough context in node properties that the node is useful on its own without traversing edges.
7. **Prefer `backpack_import_nodes` for bulk operations** — when adding 3+ nodes, batch them in a single call.

## Common Patterns

### Building an ontology from scratch
1. `backpack_create` with a descriptive name and description
2. Add foundational nodes first (the "anchors" other nodes relate to)
3. Add detail nodes and connect them with edges
4. Use `backpack_describe` to verify the structure looks right

### Answering questions from an ontology
1. `backpack_list` to find the relevant ontology
2. `backpack_search` with keywords from the user's question
3. `backpack_get_node` on the most relevant result
4. `backpack_get_neighbors` if the answer requires traversing relationships

### Updating existing knowledge
1. `backpack_search` to find the node to update
2. `backpack_get_node` to see current properties
3. `backpack_update_node` to merge in new properties (existing properties are preserved)

## Auto-Capture (Hooks)

Backpack automatically builds knowledge graphs from conversations using Claude Code hooks. Hooks are installed automatically when the MCP server starts. A background agent reviews each conversation and captures meaningful knowledge — business relationships, technical decisions, domain concepts, processes — without the user needing to call tools manually.

Two hooks are active:
- **Auto-capture (Stop hook)**: a background agent reviews conversations and adds meaningful knowledge to the backpack
- **Viewer suggestions (PostToolUse hook)**: reminds the user to visualize their graph after updates

### What auto-capture looks for
- Business knowledge: client details, vendor info, pricing, partnerships, workflows
- Technical knowledge: architecture, APIs, data flows, integrations, design decisions
- Domain knowledge: industry concepts, terminology, regulations, best practices
- Operational knowledge: decisions made, problems solved, processes established, conventions
- Relationships: how people, systems, concepts, or processes connect

### What auto-capture skips
- Simple Q&A with no lasting value
- Debugging that led nowhere
- Casual conversation or greetings
- Knowledge already captured in a previous pass

### Disabling auto-capture
To disable, the user can remove the backpack hooks from `.claude/settings.json`. Running `npx backpack-init` will reinstall them.

## Visualization

Backpack includes a web-based graph visualizer with force-directed layout and live reload.

### Launching the viewer

When the user asks to "visualize", "show the graph", "see the ontology", or "open the viewer":

1. Run `npx backpack-viewer` via Bash to start the viewer server on localhost
2. The viewer starts on `http://localhost:5173` by default
3. In Cowork: open the URL in the browser so the user can see the graph immediately
4. In Claude Code: inform the user the viewer is running and they can open `http://localhost:5173` in their browser

The viewer reads ontology data directly from the same storage location (`~/.local/share/backpack/ontologies/`) and supports live reload — changes made via MCP tools appear in the visualization automatically.

### When to suggest visualization
- After building or significantly modifying an ontology
- After auto-capture updates an ontology
- When the user is exploring a complex graph with many relationships
- When the user asks about the overall structure or shape of their data

## Syncing to Backpack App

**IMPORTANT**: When the user says anything about syncing their backpack — "sync my backpack", "sync to cloud", "upload to cloud", "move to cloud", "sync to remote", "push to cloud" — IMMEDIATELY run the sync command. Do NOT ask clarifying questions. Do NOT try to use MCP tools. Do NOT check what's in the backpack first. Just run the command:

```bash
npx backpack-sync
```

The sync tool handles everything automatically:
- Reads local ontologies from disk
- Authenticates with Backpack App (reuses cached credentials or opens browser)
- Uploads all ontologies to the cloud
- Reports what was created/updated

After syncing, tell the user their ontologies are now in Backpack App and they can switch to cloud mode by updating their MCP config to use `backpack-app` instead of `backpack`.
